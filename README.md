My Django project using Google API!

The Google APIs that I used include:

Google Geocoding API,

Google Maps API,

Google Roads API,

Google Calendar API

This project allows you to make users in a database and then schedule events 
with them through the Google APIs.

This allow you to query for an event, and then the API will automatically match a location 
with your query and schedule an event with the desired person. 

Note: You will need to create your own Google API key to successfully run
the API calls, and have that Google API key text in the first line of your 
"secrets.txt" file
